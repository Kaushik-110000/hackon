## 📦 Project Overview

🌍 **Sustainable shopping is hard.**  
Greenwashed marketing. Confusing claims. No real way to know what's actually eco-friendly — and no reward for choosing better.

We’re here to fix that.

### 🚀 What We’ve Built

An interactive platform that makes green shopping:

- ♻️ **Clear** – See exactly how sustainable a product is with our **Carbon Footprint Estimator**
- 🤖 **Smart** – Get eco-friendly alternatives from our **AI-powered assistant**
- 🪙 **Rewarding** – Earn **Green Coins** for every eco-conscious action you take

### 🌱 Why It Matters

We don’t just tell you what’s green — we show you, help you choose better, and reward you for it.

Sustainability shouldn’t be a chore. With our platform, it becomes a habit.

## 🚀 Feature Deep-Dive

## ♻️ Carbon Footprint Estimator

The **Carbon Footprint Estimator** is a utility used to evaluate the environmental impact of products across their entire lifecycle — from raw materials to disposal. It calculates the total CO₂ emissions associated with a product and generates a **Green Score** to reflect sustainability. This score also determines how many **Green Coins** the user earns.

### Key Features

- 🧱 **Raw Material Footprint** – Calculates emissions based on type and weight of input materials
- ⚙️ **Manufacturing Impact** – Computes CO₂ from energy usage and source (e.g., renewable vs grid)
- 🚛 **Transportation Emissions** – Assesses emissions based on transport mode, distance, and weight
- 📦 **Packaging Footprint** – Factors in type and weight of packaging material
- 🗑️ **Disposal Impact** – Adjusts footprint based on recyclability and biodegradability
- 🌿 **Green Score Calculation** – Evaluates product sustainability (0–100) using footprint + eco features
- 🪙 **Green Coin Rewards** – Assigns coin rewards based on score and purchase amount

### How It Works

1. **Input**: A `ProductData` object containing materials, manufacturing details, transport routes, packaging, and disposal info.
2. **Footprint Calculation**: Computes CO₂ values for each lifecycle stage using predefined emission factors.
3. **Sustainability Assessment**: Applies `SustainabilityFeatures` like recyclability, renewable energy, or organic content to boost score.
4. **Green Coins Output**: Final reward is based on eco-score and the price of the product.
